title: Principles of Data Management - An Economist's View
---

###

The [roderick.dev](https://www.roderick.dev) blog captures my thoughts and works in progress. Recent work has opened the opportunity to better understand data management. As a field and philosophy, data management helps organizations apply best practices in data governance and organization, corral the use of data, and look for bad information. A key learning in my early days of MLE/data science was that bad data scales as well as, or better than, good data. (This is true for machine learning applications generally).

How does one improve on the situation? By investing in data management processes.

### Principles

The data management association [DAMA International](https://www.dama.org/cpages/home) defines core principles in data management below, to which I add my thoughts.

#### 1 - Recognize that data has value
Think about a data record you worked with recently. Maybe it came from an open data source, like the US Census or HMDA. Maybe it is an image of a medical procedure. Or maybe it was collected by a digital services application. That collection has a cost! And the record itself may serve as a resource for monetization (direct or indirect). The key to understand: data can be a *resource* for an organization -- to improve itself, to build a product that makes its users' lives easier, to identify gaps. To describe, and to define. These are valuable outcomes that use data.

If data systems, processes, and technology are after thoughts,

#### 2 - Data management requirements are business requirements
#### 3 - Data has a lifecycle
#### 4 - Data management is broader than one skills
