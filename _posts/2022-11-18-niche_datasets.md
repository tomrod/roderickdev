title: Niche datasets
---

I love finding niche datasets. Information search costs can be high despite the prevalence of surface-level search engines like Google and Bing. <!--more-->

Here are a few sources I use for improving data discovery:
* [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/)
* [Reddit Open Data](https://www.reddit.com/r/opendata)
* [Reddit Datasets](https://www.reddit.com/datasets)
* [Opendata Stackexchange](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/)
* [Amazon Open Data](https://aws.amazon.com/opendata/)
* [ESRI Open Data](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-open-data)

I'd love to hear your approach! Connect with me on Mastodon at @tomrod@econtwitter.net
