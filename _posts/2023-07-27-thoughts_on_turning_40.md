title: Thoughts on turning 40
---

Seeing as I recently turned 40, I thought I'd take on the time-honored and cherished tradition of writing my thoughts. Yes, this is one of those posts where people post about their thoughts when reaching an arbitrary milestone accomplished only by having the good sense and luck to not die by misadventure or misfortune before a certain number of days have passed. If you're reading this blog, we've probably interacted at some point in my life. Thanks for that -- every little bit of life, experience, and such have made me the man I am today.

Here are some words I've come to live by. Some are quotes from others, but having tried them on like a nice winter jacket and found them right, I

1. Get sleep. Tomorrow is always a new day.
2. Time is the most valuable asset you have. Invest wisely, celebrate the wins and don't sweat the losses.
3. Never take a person's last dollar
4. Everyone has a story to tell
5. There never was a good war or a bad peace
6. Be busy, but not so busy with the small stuff that you lose the whole picture.
7. Embrace reality and deal with it
8. Any fool can criticize, condemn and complainâ€”and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving. The greatest gift is the ability to forget - to forget the bad things and focus on the good.
9. Cognitive dissonance is your subconcious begging for you to wake up.
10. We may not have chosen the circumstances of our life, but we choose how to respond and rise to the occasion.
11. Trust, but verify.
12. Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.
13. When people show you who they are, believe them the first time.
14. Talk openly with the people you care about and love.
15. Family is not always by blood. It is by heart.
